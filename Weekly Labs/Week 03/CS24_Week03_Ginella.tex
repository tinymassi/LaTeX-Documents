	\begin{itemize}
		\item Began tinkering with various RISC-V instructions \& reviewed notes from class out loud for about an hour.
		\item Received an Arduino kit and began reading about all the parts in the kit as well as their functionalities.
		\item Practiced some more RISC-V instruction conversions into binary because I think they're fun.
		\item Watched some videos on fun Arduino projects that I may want to try in the future.
