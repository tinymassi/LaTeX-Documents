	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spent time trying to figure out what a 74HC595 is. Eventually got it.
		\item Watched some videos and took some more notes on 74HC595.
		\item Watched some videos on pipelining and did some extra practice problems outside of the Chapter Homework.
		\item Watched some videos and took some notes on rotary encoders.
		\item Took some time to understand the layout of the 7 segment display
		\item Tried to progress through the 2nd arduino lab but realized that I don't have x2 7 segment displays and the kit doesn't come with a rotary encoder...
